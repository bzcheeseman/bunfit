# Bunfit

This project is dedicated to using C++ for curve fitting, and using the impressive plotting abilities of Matplotlib (from python) to visualize results.  The applicability is mostly for live-type code, where results are required instantly.  This project is under construction, and anything even under the master branch has no guarantee of any kind.  Eventually I will hopefully have something that is robust enough and works well enough with minimal input from the person working on it that I will be able to release it for real.  For now, if you have suggestions please, by all means, let me know how to improve - or make the changes and tell me what they are!

This is a pet project, and so there are no guarantees anything will work, or that I will bug fix in a timely manner.  Very much a side project, at least for now.

Due to an exam, there is nothing in this repo for now.  As soon as I get some time I will move things in here, get a code base started.
